# Scratch Utilities
A Scratch extension with all sorts of handy blocks. This is an exhaustive list of its features:
- List averaging (space-separated values)
- Generating multiple random numbers
- Getting the user's timezone
- Text slicing (getting, for example, characters 1 through 5 of a string)

Planned features:
- Order a list alphabetically or numerically, descending or ascending
- Convert a string to a number suitable for usage with cloud variables
- Direct JavaScript commands

I'm just a veteran scratcher trying their hand at custom extensions (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/dozer8383).

If you wanna try it out (no epicness guaranteed):
